About Me
======
I am a final-year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/). I am a member of Stanford [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) and [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab](https://fintech.stanford.edu/).

**I am on the 2022-23 academic job market.**

[Curriculum Vitae](https://linfanf.github.io/files/LinFan_CV_Sept2022.pdf)

My [research](https://linfanf.github.io/research/) interests lie broadly in stochastic systems, with emphasis on sequential learning and decision-making under uncertainty, as well as statistical methodology for applications from operations research/management. 

For sequential decision-making problems, I am intrested in better understanding the trade-off between optimizing for average performance vs ensuring reliability/safety. My goal here is to design algorithms with good practical performance, for which we more fully understand operational risks. Along this direction, I have been focused on the distribution, and especially the tail properties, of regret, which provides a new perspective different from that of expected regret in the current literature. 

Another thread of my work is to develop statistical tools to better evaluate the performance of service systems. I am particularly interested in computationally and statistically efficient ways to bring data and inference to models from applied probability that used in operations applications. Examples include general state space Markov chains, as well as other models where the emphasis has traditionally been on analytic insights and tractability.

#Here are a few highlights:
#- Applied probability
#  - especially applied to multi-armed bandit problems, with the goal of extracting new insights and better informing algorithm design
#- Statistical inference for stochastic processes
#  - special focus on statistically and computationally efficient estimation for general state space Markov chains, with driving noise coming from observed #data
#  - applications include service operations and economic time series
#- Stochastic simulation
#  - nonparametric input uncertainty quantification
#  - sensitivity analysis
#  - MCMC
