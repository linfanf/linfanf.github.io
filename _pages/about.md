About Me
======
Hi! I am a final-year PhD student at Stanford, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/). I am part of the [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group within [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/).

My research interests include:

- applied probability
    - especially applied to sequential learning and decision-making problems
- statistical inference for stochastic processes
    - with applications to service operations and econometrics
- stochastic simulation

**I will be on the 2022-23 academic job market**
