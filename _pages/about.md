About Me
======
I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Operations Department](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/academics/operations.aspx) of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. From 2023-2024, I was a Postdoctoral Scientist in the [Supply Chain Optimization Technologies](https://www.amazon.science/tag/supply-chain-optimization-technologies) group at Amazon, supervised by [Garrett van Ryzin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7KI2Fa8AAAAJ&hl=en). I obtained my PhD in 2023 in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/).

My [research](https://linfanf.github.io/research/) interests are at the interface of applied probability and data-driven operations, with specializations in multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, statistical inference for stochastic processes, and stochastic simulation.
