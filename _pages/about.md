About Me
======
Hi! I'm a final-year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/). I'm a member of Stanford's [Operations Research group](https://or.stanford.edu/) and [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab](https://fintech.stanford.edu/).

**I am on the 2022-23 academic job market.**   
    
Here is my [CV](https://linfanf.github.io/files/LinFan_CV_August2022.pdf). Below is a summary of my research interests. For more information, please visit my [research page](https://linfanf.github.io/research/).
    
My research interests include:
- Applied probability
  - especially applied to sequential learning and decision-making problems
- Statistical inference for stochastic processes
  - with applications to service operations and econometric time series
- Stochastic simulation
  - input uncertainty quantification, sensitivity analysis
