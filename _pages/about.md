About Me
======
I am a final-year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/). I am a member of Stanford [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) and [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab](https://fintech.stanford.edu/).

**I am on the 2022-23 academic job market.**   

Email: linfan [at] stanford.edu
    
[Curriculum Vitae](https://linfanf.github.io/files/LinFan_CV_Sept2022.pdf)

My [research](https://linfanf.github.io/research/) interests lie broadly in stochastic systems, with emphasis on sequential learning and decision-making under uncertainty, as well as statistical methodology for applications arising in operations research/management. Here are a few highlights:
- Applied probability
  - especially applied to multi-armed bandit problems, with the goal of extracting new insights and better informing algorithm design
- Statistical inference for stochastic processes
  - special focus on statistically and computationally efficient estimation for general state space Markov chains, with driving noise coming from observed data
  - applications include service operations and economic time series
- Stochastic simulation
  - nonparametric input uncertainty quantification
  - sensitivity analysis
  - MCMC
