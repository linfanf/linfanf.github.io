About Me
======
Hi! I'm a final-year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/). I'm a member of Stanford [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) and [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab](https://fintech.stanford.edu/).

**I am on the 2022-23 academic job market.**   
    
[Curriculum Vitae](https://linfanf.github.io/files/LinFan_CV_August2022.pdf)

Summary of my [research](https://linfanf.github.io/research/) interests:
- Applied probability
  - especially applied to multi-armed bandit problems, with the goal of extracting new insights and better informing algorithm design
- Statistical inference for stochastic processes
  - special focus on statistically and computationally efficient estimation for Markov chains with driving noise coming from observed data
  - applications include service operations and economic time series
- Stochastic simulation
  - nonparametric input uncertainty quantification
  - sensitivity analysis
  - MCMC
