About Me
======
Hi! I'm a final-year PhD student in [Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu/) at Stanford, where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Peter Glynn](https://web.stanford.edu/~glynn/). I'm part of Stanford's [Operations Research](https://or.stanford.edu/) group.
    
My research interests include:
- Applied probability
  - especially applied to sequential learning and decision-making problems
- Statistical inference for stochastic processes
  - with applications to service operations and econometrics
- Stochastic simulation    
       
&nbsp;  
**I am on the 2022-23 academic job market.**
